Tuple Out is an exciting dice-based game written in Python, where players compete to achieve a target score of 50 points within five rounds.

 Each turn starts with rolling three dice, and the challenge is to avoid "tuple out" (when all three dice show the same value), which results in a score of zero for the round. 
 
 Players can fix dice with matching values and choose whether to reroll the remaining dice or keep their current score. 
 
 This decision-making element adds a layer of strategy as players balance the risks of rerolling with the potential for higher scores.
